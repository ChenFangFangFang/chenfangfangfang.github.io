        <p class="introduction">
          I'm currently a university student in Helsinki, and I'm eager to share
          a few valuable study and work tips that have proven beneficial for me.
          I hope you find them as helpful as I have.
        </p>
        <p class="introduction">
          Additionally, since I'm relatively new to Helsinki, I've decided to
          document some aspects of my daily life in this vibrant city. Every
          experience is a new adventure, and the excitement of exploring the
          unknown is palpable. I'll be sharing snippets of my journey, from
          navigating the city to discovering interesting places and making the
          most of my time here. It's a fascinating chapter of my life, and I'm
          enthusiastic about capturing and sharing these moments. If you're also
          navigating through the novelty of a new environment, I hope my
          experiences resonate with you. Let's embark on this journey together!
