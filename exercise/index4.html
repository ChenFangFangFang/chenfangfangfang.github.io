    Together with the cities of Espoo, Vantaa and Kauniainen - and surrounding commuter towns, including the neighbouring municipality of Sipoo to the east - Helsinki forms the Greater Helsinki Metropolitan Area. It has a population of over 1.5 million. Often considered Finland's only metropolis, it is the world's northernmost metropolitan area with over one million inhabitants and the northernmost capital of an EU member state. Helsinki is the third largest municipality in the Nordic countries after Stockholm and Oslo, and its urban area is the second largest in the Nordic countries after Stockholm. The official languages are Finnish and Swedish. The city is served by Helsinki Airport, located in the neighbouring city of Vantaa, with frequent flights to many destinations in Europe, North America and Asia.
